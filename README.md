## Introduction
Swimming can be challenging for people with visual impairments. They may have difficulty orienting themselves in the water and staying in their lane, without veer off course toward the lane line. They may also have difficulty knowing when they have reached the end of the pool.

We propose a Swimmer Assistive System that consists of computer vision equipment and a Bluetooth-enabled bone conduction earphone.

The computer vision equipment includes a Coral Micro Board and an ESP32 Dev Kit: the Coral Micro Board identifies the swimmerâ€™s location, while the ESP32 Dev Kit that broadcasts audible feedback via Bluetooth.

The swimmer wears a bone conduction earphone, that is enabled with Bluetooth, to hear their location that is inferred by the computer vision equipment.

+-----------+                     +------------+       

The computer vision equipment is installed somewhere above the swimming pool.
The bone conduction earphone is weared by the swimmer. A swimming cap is recommended to prevent lost of the earphone during swimming.

## Flow of communication between Coral Dev Board Micro and ESP32

    coral                                 esp32
      |                                     |

      |   I2cResponse::A2dpDisconnected     |
      | <---------------------------------- |
      |                                     |
      |                                     |
      |       loop IsA2dpConnected          |
      |       until A2dpConnected           |
      |                                     |

      |   I2cResponse::Success or           |
      |   I2cResponse::ErrorInvalidParam or |
      |   I2cResponse::ErrorDisconnected    |
      | <---------------------------------- |

    note:
    1. coral sends I2cCommand::PlaySound command every 0.5s
    2. coral re-start I2cCommand::IsA2dpConnected flow once "I2cResponse::ErrorDisconnected" is received

## Code explanation

### I2C address
The I2C slave address of ESP32 is defined in the macro "I2C_DEV_ADDR" in the file "./src/app/thread/ThreadReporter.cpp"
Here's an example of setting the I2C slave address to "0x55".
```
#define I2C_DEV_ADDR ((uint8_t)0x55)
```

```

### Debug
Enable or disable log be defining/undefining macro on "src/LibLog.h"

Debug is disabled by "#undef DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL"
Enable trace debug by "#define DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL Debug"

Example of LibLog.h
```
// enable debug log by defining the following macro
#define DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL Debug
// disable debug log by comment out the macro DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL 
// #undef DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL
```
---
### Troubleshooting
If you get compilation errors, more often than not, you may need to install a newer version of the coralmicro.

Sometimes, the project will only work if you update the board core to the latest version because I am using newly added functions.
