## Introduction
Swimming can be challenging for people with visual impairments. They may have difficulty orienting themselves in the water and staying in their lane, without veer off course toward the lane line. They may also have difficulty knowing when they have reached the end of the pool.

We propose a Swimmer Assistive System that consists of computer vision equipment and a Bluetooth-enabled bone conduction earphone.

The computer vision equipment includes a Coral Micro Board and an ESP32 Dev Kit: the Coral Micro Board identifies the swimmerâ€™s location, while the ESP32 Dev Kit that broadcasts audible feedback via Bluetooth.

The swimmer wears a bone conduction earphone, that is enabled with Bluetooth, to hear their location that is inferred by the computer vision equipment.

## Swimmer Assistive System
There are two pieces of hardware in the swimmer assistance system. The first piece of hardware is a computer vision device that monitors the swimmer and broadcasts audible feedback. The second piece of hardware is a Bluetooth-enabled bone-conduction earphone, which is available on common e-commerce sites.

+-----------+                     +------------+       

note 1: The computer vision equipment is installed somewhere above the swimming pool.
note 2: The bone conduction earphone is worn by the swimmer. A swimming cap is recommended to prevent loss of the earphone during swimming.
```

## Computer vision equipment
There are two core components in the Computer Vision Equipment. The first one is a Coral Dev Board Micro, which monitors the swimmer and whose firmware is available on [freertos-coral-swimmer](https://github.com/teamprof/freertos-coral-swimmer). The second one is an ESP32 DevKit, which broadcasts audible feedback and whose firmware is available on [esp32-a2dp-source](https://github.com/teamprof/esp32-a2dp-source).

[![coral-esp32-adapter](/doc/image/pcba.jpg)](https://github.com/teamprof/esp32-a2dp-source/blob/main/doc/image/pcba.jpg)

---
## Software 
1. Install [Coral Dev Board Micro](https://coral.ai/docs/dev-board-micro/get-started)
2. Clone this repository by "git clone https://github.com/teamprof/github-freertos-coral-swimmer"
---


## Download and build firmwares for the Coral Assistive System
Since there are two MCUs (NXP i.MX RT1176 and ESP32) in the "computer vision device", They have to flash separately.

### Download, build and flash firmware on ESP32 
Please following the instruction on "https://github.com/teamprof/github-esp32-a2dp-source"about how to flash the ESP32 firmware.

### Download, build and flash firmware on Coral Dev Board Micro
Launch a Ubuntu/Linux terminal and type the following commands to download, build and flash the firmware on the Coral Dev Board Micro
1. git clone https://github.com/teamprof/github-freertos-coral-swimmer
2. cd github-freertos-coral-swimmer
3. git submodule update --init --recursive
4. bash coralmicro/setup.sh
5. cmake -B out -S .
6. make -C out -j4
7. python3 coralmicro/scripts/flashtool.py --build_dir out --elf_path out/coralmicro-app

For more information about creating a project, either in-tree or out-of-tree, see the guide
to [Build apps with FreeRTOS for the Dev Board Micro](https://coral.ai/docs/dev-board-micro/freertos/).

**Note:** This project depends on [coralmicro](https://github.com/google-coral/coralmicro),
which requires about 2.5 GB.  

## Run the Coral Assistive System
1. Launch a Serial terminal, set baud rate to 115200 and connect it to the USB port of the COral Dev Board Micro
2. Power on both the Coral Dev Board Micro and ESP32. Power on the Bluetooth speaker. If everything goes smooth, you should see the followings on the serial terminal:
[![serial terminal screen](/doc/image/serial-terminal-bluetooth-connected.png)](https://github.com/teamprof/github-freertos-coral-swimmer/blob/main/doc/image/serial-terminal-bluetooth-connected.png)


## Setup and run Python script
Install Python plugins and run the Python script to see the image and detection results from the Coral Dev Board Micro
1. python3 -m pip install -r py/requirements.txt
2. python3 py/coral_swimmer.py
3. Place a blue-colored box under the camera. If the box is detected, you should see the box inside a white frame on the GUI app. The "Status LED" on the Coral Dev Board Micro should also be turned on.
4. Power up the Bluetooth speaker and wait a couple of seconds. Once the ESP32 DevKit is connected to the Bluetooth speaker, the "User LED" on the Coral Dev Board Micro should be turned on.
5. Place a doll on the blue-colored box. 
   When the swimmer is in the middle, you should see a green-colored rectangle in the GUI app around the swimmer, and hear a "beep" tone on the Bluetooth speaker.
   When the swimmer is near the left lane rope, you should see a red-colored rectangle in the GUI app around the swimmer, and hear a "bright" tone on the Bluetooth speaker.
   When the swimmer is near the right lane rope, you should see a red-colored rectangle in the GUI app around the swimmer, and hear a "bell" tone on the Bluetooth speaker.
If everything goes smooth, you should see the following GUI app on Ubuntu:

      |   I2cResponse::ErrorDisconnected    |
      | <---------------------------------- |

    note:
    1. coral sends I2cCommand::PlaySound command every 0.5s
    2. coral re-start I2cCommand::IsA2dpConnected flow once "I2cResponse::ErrorDisconnected" is received
```

## LED
- User LED: turn on when detected lane
- Status LED: turn on when Bluetooth speaker is connected

## Code explanation

### I2C address
The I2C slave address of ESP32 is defined in the macro "I2C_DEV_ADDR" in the file "./src/app/thread/ThreadReporter.cpp"
Here's an example of setting the I2C slave address to "0x55".
```
#define I2C_DEV_ADDR ((uint8_t)0x55)
```

### ThreadReporter
The I2C communication code is implemented in the file "./src/app/thread/ThreadReporter.cpp". "ThreadReporter" is responsible for the following tasks:
1. Pool ESP32 on I2C bus regularly, to check Bluetooth (earphone) connection status on ESP32
2. listens event from "ThreadInference", sends commands to ESP32 via I2C

### ThreadInference
"ThreadInference" (./src/app/thread/ThreadInference.cpp) is responsible for the following tasks:
1. initialize tesnsorflow machine learning code 
2. perform objects detection regularly
3. computes swimmer location and sends event to "ThreadInference"

### QueueMainM7
"QueueMainM7" (./src/app/thread/QueueMainM7.cpp) is responsible for the following tasks:
1. Turn "User LED" on when detected lane
2. Turn "Status LED" on when Bluetooth speaker is connected

### Please refer to source code for details

## Demo
## *** Video demo will be available in E/Nov ***


---
### Debug
Enable or disable log be defining/undefining macro on "src/LibLog.h"

Debug is disabled by "#undef DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL"
Enable trace debug by "#define DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL Debug"

Example of LibLog.h
```
// enable debug log by defining the following macro
#define DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL Debug
// disable debug log by comment out the macro DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL 
// #undef DEBUG_LOG_LEVEL
```
---
### Troubleshooting
If you get compilation errors, more often than not, you may need to install a newer version of the coralmicro.

Sometimes, the project will only work if you update the board core to the latest version because I am using newly added functions.

---
### Issues
